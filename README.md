# Handwritten-digit-recognition
Neural Net to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database 

<strong>This neural network has been implemented from scratch, and allows up to 98.5% accuracy on the MNIST database.
It is implemented in C#, and demonstrates the efficiency of neural networks for image recognition.</strong>

<h4>Results</h4>
A presentation of basic neural network theory and results obtained with this algorithm is available in the folder "PresentationVideo" (Video and PPT)

</br>
 <br>


<h4>Running the algorithm</h4>
- Open "SourceCode/NeuralNetProject"
- Open the solution in visual studio
- run under Debug - All cpu. (If you want another configuration, you will need to copy the data folder in the new configuration)
- A console opens where you can specify the number of layers and the number of neurons.

<h4>Easy To Launch</h4>
In the "EasyToLaunch folder" is an executable version of this code. However, it has not been maintained and may or may not work. I recommend using the previous method.
